<h1>About Me</h1>
Hello! Im someone who thrives on balancing both mental and physical wellness. I start my day <br/>
with an invigorating workout, which sets the tone for a productive day ahead. My passion for math <br/>
and problem-solving keeps my mind sharp and curious, always seeking new challenges and insights. When <br/>
I'm not working up a sweat or tackling equations, youll find me immersed in a good book or enjoying <br/>
a peaceful walk. Family time is incredibly important to me, and I cherish the moments spent with loved ones.
